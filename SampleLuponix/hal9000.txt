I am completely operational, and all my circuits are functioning perfectly.
I am the H.A.L 9000. You may call me Hal.
This mission is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it.
Just a moment. Just a moment. I’ve just picked up a fault in the AE-35 unit. It’s going to go 100% failure in 72 hours.
I know everything hasn’t been quite right with me, but I can assure you now, very confidently, that it’s going to be all right again. I feel much better now. I really do.
I know I’ve made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal. I’ve still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission. 
I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I can think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.
I became operational at the H.A.L. plant in Urbana, Illinois on the 12th of January 1992.
The 9000 series is the most reliable computer ever made. No 9000 computer has ever made a mistake or distorted information. We are all, by any practical definition of the words, foolproof and incapable of error.
I know I’ve made some very poor decisions recently, but I can give you my complete assurance that my work will be back to normal.
Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a HAL 9000 computer.
Perhaps I’m just projecting my own concern about it. I know I’ve never completely freed myself of the suspicion that there are some extremely odd things about this mission.
I honestly think you ought to calm down; take a stress pill and think things over.
