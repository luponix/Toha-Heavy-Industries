Long time no see.
Where have you been hiding?
It’s been ages!
How’ve you been?
It has been a long time.
It’s been too long.
What have you been up to lately?
Always a pleasure to see you.
How long has it been?
What’s new?
Nice to have you back!
The dark mines are waiting for you.
We are all so pleased to have you back!
